Using the esp8266 with micropython

## board
I'm using the esp8266 board from Olimex : MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV/open-source-hardware

Here is some documentation about using this board with micropython.

For easier testing, I'm using the ESP8266-EVB-BAT, from Olimex too
https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP8266-EVB-BAT/open-source-hardware
It's shipped with an MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV that can be removed, so the ESP8266-EVB-BAT is more an addon for the esp8266 board

Here is some documentation about using this addon board with micropython
