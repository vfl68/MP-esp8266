Using the esp8266 with micropython

## board
I'm using the esp8266 board from Olimex : [MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV/open-source-hardware)

[Here](docs/mp-mod-wifi-esp8266-dev.md) is some documentation about using this board with micropython.

For easier testing, I'm using the [ESP8266-EVB-BAT](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP8266-EVB-BAT/open-source-hardware
), from Olimex too
It's shipped with an MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV that can be removed, so the ESP8266-EVB-BAT is more an addon for the esp8266 board

[Here](docs/mp-esp8266-evb-bat.md) is some documentation about using this addon board with micropython
